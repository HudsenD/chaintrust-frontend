# SolventSwap Website

I have created a website using NextJS, Wagmi, and Typescript so that users can seamlessly interact with the dexV2 contract I created. Users can choose to mint either USDC or HD tokens on the goerli testnet which will enable them to swap one for the other using the dexV2 contract.

## Backend

The DexV2 contract used in this project is in this repository:
https://github.com/HudsenD/LP-dex

## Technologies

Project is made with:

-   NextJS
-   Wagmi
-   Rainbowkit
-   DaisyUI
-   Typescript
-   TailwindCSS
