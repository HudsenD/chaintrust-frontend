# ChainTrust: Digital Trust Funds on the Blockchain

ChainTrust is a innovative platform that symbolizes each Trust as a unique NFT (Non-Fungible Token) with its own distinct wallet address using ERC-6551. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, ChainTrust ensures secure asset ownership and seamless transfer to beneficiaries.

## Features

- **Secure and Transparent**: Built on top of Ethereum, ChainTrust ensures the utmost security and transparency for all transactions.
